## 0. Lockboxes

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

- Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
- boxes is a list of lists
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box
- You can assume all keys will be positive integers
- There can be keys that do not have boxes
- The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
- Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False

```bash
cat main_0.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

canUnlockAll = **import**('0-lockboxes').canUnlockAll

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))
```

[[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
[[1, 4, 5], [2], [5, 2], [3], [4, 1], [3, 5]]
[[4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
